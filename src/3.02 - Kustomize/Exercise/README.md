# 🌌 Lab 3.02 – Modularizing the Fleet with Kustomize

### **The Kuat Drive Yards initiative – configuration domination**

The Empire is expanding its fleet production and deployment facilities. Kuat Drive Yards, the core shipbuilding world, has begun using **declarative configuration overlays** to optimize deployments across varying planetary environments — from lava worlds like Mustafar to icy moons like Hoth.

To maintain uniform control and reduce manual misconfiguration by rebel infiltrators, Imperial engineers are now required to **standardize deployments using Kustomize** — a tool that enables **base/overlay configuration management** across different sectors.

## 🎯 Mission objectives

As a systems officer in DevOps Command, your mission is to:

1. Create a **Kustomization base** for the `tie-squadron` deployment and service.
2. Create **overlays** for:

   - A **development** environment with 1 replica.
   - An **acceptance** environment with 5 replicas and higher resource limits.

3. Use **Kustomize** to build and apply each overlay independently.
4. Validate that the applied configurations match the environment specs.

## 🧭 Step-by-step: building the fleet configs

### 1. 🔧 Establish the Base

Inside `tie-squadron/base/`, define the **Deployment** and **Service** manifests. Then create a `kustomization.yaml` to include them both.

```yaml
# tie-squadron/base/kustomization.yaml
resources:
  - tie-squadron.yaml
  - service.yaml
```

---

### 2. 🧪 Create the Development Overlay

Inside `overlays/dev/`, create:

- A `kustomization.yaml` that points to the base, points to the `<environment>-imperial-fleet` namespace and includes a patch.
- A `patch.yaml` that sets `replicas: 1` and adjusts resource limits

```yaml
# overlays/dev/kustomization.yaml
resources:
  - ../../base

namespace: dev-imperial-fleet

patches:
  - path: patch.yaml
```

```yaml
# overlays/dev/patch.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: tie-squadron
spec:
  replicas: 1
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: tie-fighter
          resources:
            requests:
              cpu: "200m"
              memory: "128Mi"
```

---

### 3. 🛰️ Create the Acceptance Overlay

Do the same under `overlays/acc/` but bump `replicas` to 5 and increase requests.

---

### 4. 🛠️ Apply with Kustomize

From the root directory, deploy each overlay using:

```bash
kubectl apply -k overlays/dev/
kubectl apply -k overlays/acc/
```

Make sure to create the namespaces first if they don't exist:

```bash
kubectl create namespace dev-imperial-fleet
kubectl create namespace acc-imperial-fleet
```

Use `kubectl get deployment tie-squadron -n <namespace>` to confirm the correct `replicas` and configuration.
